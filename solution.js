/* 
ðŸŒŸ APP: Fighting Game

Create an updateGame() function that will update the DOM with the state of the game ðŸ‘‡
========================================

- updateGame()

These are the 2 classes you must create and their methods ðŸ‘‡
========================================

class Player {
  - strike()
  - heal()
}

class Game {
  - play()
  - checkIsOver()
  - declareWinner()
  - reset()
}

These functions are hard coded in the HTML. So, you can't change their names.

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to ðŸ‘‡
========================================================
#1 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'play' = Button to run simulation
#2 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'result' = Div that holds the winner of the match
#3 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'p1Health' = Div that holds player 1's health
#4 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'p2Health' = Div that holds player 2's health

// ** Create 2 players using the player class **

// ** Save original Player Data **
let p1 = player1
let p2 = player2

// ** Create the game object from the Game class **
let game = new Game()
// ** Initialize the game by calling updateGame() **
updateGame(p1,p2,game.isOver)

// ** Save original Game Data **



// ** Add a click listener to the simulate button that runs the play() method on click and pass in the players **



// ** BONUS **
// Add functionality where players can press a button to attack OR heal

// ** Player 1 Controls **




// ** Player 2 Controls **



console.log(p1.heal(p1))
